1. Difference between latches and flip-flops:
   Latches:
   1. A latch is an asynchronous device
   2. Latches do not require clock signal
   3. Operation depends on enable signal.
   4. It is a level triggered device
   5. They are simple to design as there is no clock signal 
   6. Operation is faster
   7. Power requirement is less.
   Flip-Flops:
   1. A flip-flop is a synchronous device
   2. Flip-flop requires clock signal
   3. Operation depends on clock signal
   4. It is an edge triggered device
   5. They are complex to design as they have clock signal
   6. Operation is comparatively slower
   7. Power requirement is more.
